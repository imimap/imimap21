  intro: 'The IMI-Map is designed to make it easier for you to apply for your mandatory internship in the International Media Informatics program. Under the tab "My internship" you can enter when you want to take the complete module B20. Module 20 consists of the modules B20.1, evaluation of experiences at the internship site, and B20.2, the internship itself. Once you have told us this, you can create an internship or, if necessary, several partial internships and enter all the information there that is also required for the application. This makes it possible to go into more detail about your internship in the office hours of the internship representative in which you apply for your internship and, for example, to enter comments about your internship in the database.',

If there are fields that you cannot leave blank because the database does not allow it, you can also enter something first and then discuss this with the internship officer.',
